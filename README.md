Napster React API Project.

This was the first project which utilised using react and using external API's to directly influence the front end projects. The API
which was used was Napster React. This is a music backend API which stores music charts and genres within lists. The aim was to use 
this API to create our own website which can find top artists for specific people. There are plenty of different genres and styles 
with information within the API that was able to be displayed. Our job was to make that information more interactive and allowing 
users to quickly find information on specific artists and look at the general charts or more specific charts such as top 10 in a 
specific genre.

As this was the first project done which utilised both backend data and react there were a few struggles throughout the project such
as the using of this specific backend project. Although there was a lot of information, a lot of that information was embedded which
created an overall difficulty within the project. However, after going through that trouble I had a greater understanding of 
utilising backend information within the front end. This overall knowledge will help me in future projects when gathering the 
backend responses. Although I had learnt that inforamtion within class, the actual using of a new API helped me in understanding the
steps required in making the project functionable.

When looking to update this project, the first aspect I would change is to make the CSS more coherent between the pages. The first few pages do not seem to match and overall quality level seems to drop. This is more then likely due to the timing issue that was presented when giving this task which in turn created a prokect which was finctionable but still lacked that final CSS to make it look nicer. 
CSS aside I would also look to make the page overall more responsive to the user. Things such as registering users, logging in and saving those users to your profile could make this more functionable. However, this would mean you would need to create your own backend storage system which will be learnt and used in future projects. This is something I want to use in future projects as I believe it will make most projects more interactive for specific users.
